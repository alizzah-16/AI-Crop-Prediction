Overview

The Crop Recommendation System is an AI-powered application that predicts suitable crops based on soil parameters, helping farmers make informed decisions and improve crop yields. This system uses a Random Forest Classifier algorithm to provide accurate predictions and is built with a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

Features
- Predicts suitable crops based on soil parameters like N, P, K, pH, and temperature
- Uses a Random Forest Classifier algorithm for accurate predictions
- User-friendly interface for easy input and output
- Fast and efficient prediction capabilities

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/alizzah-16/AI-Crop-Prediction.git
2. Install the required libraries:
    - pip install streamlit
    - pip install scikit-learn
    - pip install pandas
    - pip install numpy
3. Run the application: streamlit run app.py

Usage
1. Enter the soil parameters in the input fields
2. Click the "Predict" button to get the recommended crop

Demo


The values can be set manually and the crop will be predicted based on the values . The crops are taken up from the dataset and uploaded based on the category of the input values they range in.
