Overview
The Crop Recommendation System is an AI-powered application that predicts suitable crops based on soil parameters, helping farmers make informed decisions and improve crop yields. This system uses a Random Forest Classifier algorithm to provide accurate predictions and is built with a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

Features
- Predicts suitable crops based on soil parameters like N, P, K, pH, and temperature
- Uses a Random Forest Classifier algorithm for accurate predictions
- User-friendly interface for easy input and output
- Fast and efficient prediction capabilities

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/Crop-Recommendation-System.git
2. Install the required libraries:
    - pip install streamlit
